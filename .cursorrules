Goenka Meditation is a one-screen mobile app designed to help users quickly set up and start a meditation session based on the Goenka tradition. The interface is minimalist and clear, using multiple bottom drawers to configure all session options without leaving the main screen.

Users can:

Select a session duration (e.g. 10, 20, 30 minutes)

Personalize segments: opening chant, guidance, technique reminder, mettā practice, and closing chant

Save their favorite setups, load presets, or revisit recent sessions — all from top-right icons that open drawers

Once configured, the user taps Start and is taken to a calm, dark meditation screen with subtle visual pulses and audio playback. The session syncs to Apple Health or Google Health Connect, and optional reminders help build a regular practice.
